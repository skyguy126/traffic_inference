## 📝 **Abstract**

Provide a short paragraph (4–6 sentences) summarizing:

- The problem you addressed  
- Your approach  
- Key results  
- The significance of your findings  

This should be a standalone “TL;DR” of your project.

# **1. Introduction**

Use the introduction to clearly set context, describe motivation, and explain the central idea behind your project.

### **1.1 Motivation & Objective**  
What are you trying to do and why is it important? Explain in accessible, non-jargon terms.

### **1.2 State of the Art & Its Limitations**  
How is this problem addressed today?  
What gaps or limitations exist?  
Cite prior work using a consistent style like [Smith21].

### **1.3 Novelty & Rationale**  
What is new about your approach, and why do you expect it to succeed?

### **1.4 Potential Impact**  
If successful, what technical or broader impact could this project have?

### **1.5 Challenges**  
List the main technical, practical, or methodological challenges.

### **1.6 Metrics of Success**  
What are the specific, measurable criteria for evaluating your project?

---

# **2. Related Work**

Summarize prior works relevant to your project.  
For each: what did the authors do, how is it related, and what gap remains?

Reference all citations in **Section 6**.

---

# **3. Technical Approach**

Describe your system, methodology, algorithms, and design choices.  
Use figures generously:

- System architecture diagram  
- Data pipeline  
- Algorithm/model block diagram  
- Hardware setup photos  

💡 Tip: Add images, diagrams, and code snippets. Make your system reproducible.

Recommended subsections:

### **3.1 System Architecture**
Include a block diagram or pipeline figure.

### **3.2 Data Pipeline**
Explain how data is collected, processed, and used.

### **3.3 Algorithm / Model Details**
Use math, pseudocode, or diagrams as needed.

### **3.4 Hardware / Software Implementation**
Explain equipment, libraries, or frameworks.

### **3.5 Key Design Decisions & Rationale**
Describe the main design decisions you made.

---

# **4. Evaluation & Results**

Present experimental results with clarity and professionalism.

Include:

- Plots (accuracy, latency, energy, error curves)  
- Tables (comparisons with baselines)  
- Qualitative visualizations (spectrograms, heatmaps, bounding boxes, screenshots)  
- Ablation studies  
- Error analysis / failure cases

Each figure should have a caption and a short interpretation.

---

# **5. Discussion & Conclusions**

Synthesize the main insights from your work.

- What worked well and why?  
- What didn’t work and why?  
- What limitations remain?  
- What would you explore next if you had more time?  

This should synthesize—not merely repeat—your results.

---

# **6. References**

Provide full citations for all sources (academic papers, websites, etc.) referenced and all software and datasets uses.

---

# **7. Supplementary Material**

## **7.a. Datasets**

Describe each dataset:
* Source and URL
* Data format
* Preprocessing steps
* Labeling/annotation efforts

Include your internal dataset if you collected one.
## **7.b. Software**

List:
* External libraries or models
* Internal modules you wrote
* Links to repos or documentation

# **8. Final Presentation**

# 🧭 **Guidelines for a Strong Project Website**

- Include multiple clear, labeled figures in every major section.  
- Keep the writing accessible; explain acronyms and algorithms.  
- Use structured subsections for clarity.  
- Link to code or datasets whenever possible.  
- Ensure reproducibility by describing parameters, versions, and preprocessing.  
- Maintain visual consistency across the site.
